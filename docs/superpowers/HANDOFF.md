# Session Handoff — pm-agent A2A chat + interactive ChatPane

**Branch:** `feat/backend-agents`  ·  **Last updated:** 2026-06-08

Read this first when resuming. It captures state a fresh session can't infer from git alone.

## Kickoff message to paste into the new session

> Continue the Mee meeting-agent work on branch `feat/backend-agents`. Read CLAUDE.md,
> `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-08-unified-qa-tool-agent.md` (the current plan = Task #8),
> `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-06-happy-path-retrieval-reconcile-design.md`,
> `docs/superpowers/HANDOFF.md`, `docs/pm-agent-graph.md`.
> Phase 2 (pm-agent A2A branch) is DONE and auth is verified LIVE; chat UX is polished;
> all committed, 26 tests green. NEXT = Task #8: unify `question` + `tool` into one
> tool-calling (ReAct) agent that auto-retrieves from the DB and runs side-effect tools
> with HITL — keep `pm_task` a SEPARATE branch. Start with the LLM tool-calling probe
> (Path A native vs Path B JSON loop), then TDD Tasks 1–5 in the plan.

## Reference artifacts (all committed, self-contained)

- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-08-unified-qa-tool-agent.md` — **current plan (Task #8)**.
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-06-happy-path-retrieval-reconcile-design.md` — title-scoped
  retrieval + create_task→reconcile design.
- `docs/pm-agent-graph.md` — pm-agent's full LangGraph (auth, classify, per-skill nodes,
  need_more_info pause, issue_approve, reconcile).
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-02-pm-agent-a2a-chat-design.md` + `plans/2026-06-02-…` — Phase 2.
- `CLAUDE.md` — repo architecture + critical gotchas.

## pm-agent integration — verified facts (live)

- Auth = **per-user Microsoft OIDC**, sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (NOT static
  X-API-KEY). Code reads env **`PM_AGENT_URL`** + **`TOKEN_AUTHEN_PM_AGENT`**; URL must end `/a2a/`.
- Resume MUST echo **both `taskId` and `contextId`** (else `-32603` "Context doesn't match
  TaskManager"). Captured in `PmAgentResult.context_id` + `ChatState.pm_context_id`.
- pm-agent surfaces auth via a `need_more_info` message with a `/auth?url=…` link; ends a
  need_more_info thread on the text **`/cancel`** (the FE "Hủy" now sends that).
- Client sends Bearer + X-API-KEY (works against deployed endpoint or a local pm-agent).

## DONE this session

1. **`CLAUDE.md`** authored (repo guide).
2. **Design + lean plan** for pm-agent A2A integration written & committed.
3. **Phase 1 — ChatPane is now interactive** (frontend only, typechecks clean via `tsc --noEmit`):
   - `meeting_frontend_react/src/types/api.ts` — added `PendingAction`, `ChatTurnResult`.
   - `meeting_frontend_react/src/api/client.ts` — fixed `chat.send` to post `{text}` (was wrong
     `{message}`); replaced broken `resume`→`/resume` with `approve`/`reject` →
     `/api/chat/pending-actions/{id}/approve|reject`.
   - `meeting_frontend_react/src/i18n.ts` — added `chat.thinking/error/approve/reject/pending` (VI+EN).
   - `meeting_frontend_react/src/components/ChatPane.tsx` — was a static mockup; now stateful
     (controlled input, Enter-to-send, lazy session create per meeting, message thread, HITL
     approve/reject card, busy/error states).
4. **README** — clarified Python install (incl. `psycopg[binary]`) + UI/npm install; fixed `.venv`→`venv`.

5. **Phase 2 — pm-agent A2A chat branch (backend, Tasks 1–6 of the plan)** — DONE, 26 tests pass
   (`venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/meeting -v`):
   - `meeting/services/pm_agent_client.py` — thin httpx A2A v0.3 JSON-RPC client
     (`PmAgentClient.send_message/cancel`, `PmAgentResult`, `PmAgentError`); exported from
     `meeting/services/__init__.py`.
   - **Open Q #3 RESOLVED:** non-streaming `message/send` *does* return the interrupted Task
     (state `input-required` + `approval_request` DataPart) in the response body — verified by
     reading the a2a-sdk's `DefaultRequestHandler.on_message_send` /
     `ResultAggregator.consume_and_break_on_interrupt` (only `auth-required` breaks early;
     `input-required` lets the queue drain and returns the aggregated Task). No SSE needed.
   - `meeting/graphs/chat_graph.py` — `pm_task` intent + `pm_call` (one idempotent send, no
     interrupt) / `pm_await` (the only `interrupt()`) / `pm_reply`, looped, capped by
     `PM_MAX_ROUNDS=6`. `build_chat_graph(…, pm_client=None)` seam (prod lazily resolves
     `get_pm_agent_client()` inside `pm_call`, so non-PM chats need no `PM_AGENT_*`).
     `resume_chat_turn` now detects re-interrupts (need_more_info → need_approval).
   - `meeting/api/chat.py` — `ApprovalRequest` gains `approval_action` + `text`; pm interrupts
     persist as `PendingAction(tool_name="pm_agent")`; approve/reject build the pm decision.
     Logic in pure helpers (`_persist_fields`/`_approve_decision`/`_reject_decision`).
   - `.env.example` — `PM_AGENT_A2A_URL` / `PM_AGENT_API_KEY` / `PM_AGENT_TIMEOUT`.
   - Test infra: first suite for `meeting/` under `tests/meeting/` (`pytest.ini` asyncio
     auto-mode scoped there; `conftest.py` seeds dummy env); `requirements-dev.txt`.

## DONE since 2026-06-06 (this session)

- **pm-agent auth verified LIVE** (Bearer + Microsoft token → 200, real Redmine data).
- **`-32603` contextId bug fixed** — echo taskId + contextId on resume.
- **Client**: read `PM_AGENT_URL`/`TOKEN_AUTHEN_PM_AGENT`, Bearer auth, trailing-slash
  normalization, strip pm-agent's `/add … /cancel` hint line for display.
- **Chat UX (FE)**: markdown rendering; pending cards parsed by kind (need_more_info =
  reply input + Gửi/Hủy, need_approval = issues + approve/reject); welcome banner;
  localStorage-persisted thread per meeting (survives F5); need_more_info "Hủy" → `/cancel`.
- **Task #8 plan** written + committed.

## Task #8 — DONE (2026-06-08, this session) — unified tool-calling agent

Implemented per `plans/2026-06-08-unified-qa-tool-agent.md`, full TDD, **48 tests green**
(`venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/meeting -v`). 5 commits on `feat/backend-agents`
(`5361a76`→`1d26611`), unpushed.

- **Pre-flight verdict = Path A (native tool-calling).** `scripts/probe_tool_calling.py`
  proved the MaaS endpoint (actually **`google/gemma-4-31b-it`**, NOT Qwen3 as CLAUDE.md
  says) returns reliable `tool_calls` + parseable args, and answers directly when no tool
  is needed (loop terminates). Verdict recorded in `chat_graph.py` agent-section comment.
- **Task 1** `retrieve` read tool (`tools.py`) — hybrid retrieval via `memory_service`,
  MoM-text fallback on empty embeddings. Threaded optional `meeting_id` include-filter
  through `memory_service.retrieve` + `repo.retrieve_memory_events`.
- **Task 2** `create_task` no longer mock — builds structured tasks from explicit args OR
  the meeting's MoM `action_items` (new `repo.get_mom_action_items`). Still `side_effect`.
- **Task 3** `repo.find_meetings_by_title` (ILIKE, user-scoped) + `chat_graph.resolve_meeting`
  (bound default / title override / most-recent on ambiguity).
- **Task 4** unified agent: `load_context → classify_intent (binary: pm_task|agent) →
  agent ⇄ agent_tools → (agent_approve interrupt → agent_execute) ↺ → save_reply`.
  Replay-safe (LLM/exec nodes never interrupt; only `agent_approve` does, no side effects
  → side-effect tools run exactly once). Read tools auto-run; `meeting_id` injected
  server-side (stripped from LLM schema). New `switch_meeting` tool re-scopes by title.
  `MAX_AGENT_ROUNDS=6`. `pm_task` branch untouched (regression tests pass).
- **Task 5** removed dead `answer_node`/`propose_action_node`/`make_execute_action`/
  `route_after_classify` + `proposed_*` state. **`api/chat.py` unchanged** — the agent's
  approve interrupt reuses the local-tool payload shape `{tool,args,rationale,description}`,
  so existing approve/reject machinery drives it.

## NEXT (decided) — recording-scoped task queries (Option B)

**Problem (verified against live data):** `retrieve` is project-scoped — `memory_events`
carry only `meeting_id`, NOT `recording_id` — so "Hiệu's tasks in *Meeting 1*" returns
the whole project's aggregated memory and the LLM mis-attributes it to the named
recording. The agent has no concept of recordings (only `switch_meeting` by project
title). Accurate per-recording data already exists in `recordings.mom_json.action_items`
(correct `pic`); it just isn't queried at recording granularity.

**Chosen fix = Option B (no schema change, no migration):** add per-recording MoM tooling.
TDD in `tests/meeting/`. Steps:
1. **repo** (`meeting/db/repositories.py`):
   - `list_recordings(session, meeting_id) -> [{recording_id, label, date, has_mom}]`
     (label = `title or session_label`; reuse `get_meeting`).
   - `get_recording_action_items(session, recording_id) -> list[dict]` and/or
     `get_recording_mom(session, recording_id) -> dict|None`.
2. **tools** (`meeting/services/tools.py`, both `side_effect: False`):
   - `list_recordings` — `meeting_id` auto-injected (already stripped from LLM schema);
     lets the agent map "Meeting 1"/ordinal/date → `recording_id`.
   - `recording_mom` — arg `recording_id`; returns that recording's structured MoM
     (summary/decisions/action_items w/ `pic`). For "X's tasks in recording Y" the agent
     reads action_items and filters by `pic`. Keep `retrieve` for cross-recording semantic Q&A.
3. **agent wiring** (`chat_graph.py`): NO graph change (read tools auto-run in `agent_tools`).
   Update `_agent_system_prompt`: for a specific recording/phiên/"Meeting N", call
   `list_recordings` then `recording_mom`; CITE which recording each fact came from;
   NEVER attribute a fact to a recording it didn't read (this is also Option C mitigation).
4. **tests:** tool tests (fake repo) for both tools + read-only flag; agent_loop test —
   scripted FakeLLM does `list_recordings → recording_mom → answer` scoped to one recording.

Note: a recording named "Meeting 1" lives in project **GIP**; the bad answer came from
**AI Innovation Project** (`e7f14228`) — so resolving the right recording (and possibly the
right project) matters. `switch_meeting` resolves the project; `list_recordings` resolves
within it.

## PENDING / NEXT

- **Verify the unified agent end-to-end LIVE** through `run_meeting.py` UI — only unit-tested
  (no DB suite). Needs the live blockers below cleared (psycopg + DB at head). Worth checking:
  auto-retrieve grounding quality, that gemma honors `tool_choice=auto` in real chats, and
  that the FE approve/reject card still works against the agent interrupt (same payload shape).
- **Wire `create_task` → pm-agent `redmine_reconcile`** (spec `2026-06-06-…`): the happy-path
  goal #2 (template → reconcile) is NOT in Task #8 — `create_task` currently only *produces*
  the structured task. Could later expose pm reconcile as a tool or post-approval step.
- **`transcript_segments` injection** — still deferred (spec §5); seam in `pm_call`.
- **pm_task lifecycle deltas (PARKED)**: Edit affordance on need_approval cards; clear
  cached `pm_task_id`/`pm_context_id` on terminal so a later message doesn't reuse an
  ended task; bump `PM_MAX_ROUNDS` (reconcile/batch need several pauses).
- **transcript_segments injection** — still deferred (spec §5); seam marked in `pm_call`.
- **Verify ChatPane end-to-end live** (still only typechecked; pm flow exercised via curl,
  not yet through `run_meeting.py` UI end-to-end).

## ⚠️ Live blockers / gotchas (will bite the next session)

1. **psycopg / libpq missing** — backend crashes on startup with
   `ImportError: no pq wrapper available`. Fix: `venv/bin/pip install "psycopg[binary]"`
   (or `sudo apt-get install -y libpq5`). The LangGraph checkpointer uses psycopg3.
2. **DB migration mismatch** — the shared remote DB (`180.93.182.45`, db `agents`, user `anhvd6`)
   is stamped at Alembic revision **`0015`**, but this repo only has migrations **`0001–0007`**.
   Files `0008–0015` exist in NO branch (local or remote) — they live only on whoever advanced
   that DB. Alembic errors: `Can't locate revision identified by '0015'`. Either get those `.py`
   files committed, or point `.env` `DATABASE_URL` at a local DB at head `0007`
   (`docker compose --profile local up -d` → `localhost:5435`).
3. **Startup banner lies** — "Postgres ● stopped — run docker compose" is cosmetic; it only checks
   for a *local* container `mee-postgres`. With a remote DB it's a false alarm; ignore it.
4. **venv was purged from git history** via `git filter-repo` (it had been committed → 50 MB pack →
   HTTP 413 on push). History was rewritten; SHAs changed. Backup bundle at
   `../mee-meeting-agent-prepurge.bundle`. `venv/` is now gitignored — never commit it.
5. **GateGuard hook** fact-forces before each Bash/Edit/Write (asks for facts, passes on retry).
   It adds overhead. To disable for an implementation burst: run with `ECC_GATEGUARD=off` or add
   `pre:edit-write:gateguard-fact-force` (and `pre:bash:gateguard-fact-force`) to `ECC_DISABLED_HOOKS`.

## Backend chat contract (for reference — what the FE now expects)

- `POST /api/chat/sessions` `{meeting_id, title?}` → `{id, meeting_id, title, created_at}`
- `POST /api/chat/sessions/{id}/messages` `{text}` → `{status:"complete", reply, ...}` OR
  `{status:"interrupted", pending_action_id, pending_action:{id, tool, args, rationale?, description?}}`
- `POST /api/chat/pending-actions/{id}/approve` `{edited_args?, reason?}` → `{status:"executed", reply}`
- `POST /api/chat/pending-actions/{id}/reject` `{reason?}` → `{status:"rejected", reply}`
